"Africa: AI Policies in Africa - Lessons From Ghana and Rwanda - allAfrica.com AllAfrica English (current) En Français Toggle navigation My Account Toggle navigation AllAfrica My Account English (current) En Français Africa: AI Policies in Africa - Lessons From Ghana and Rwanda 25 April 2025 The Conversation Africa (Johannesburg) analysis By Thompson Gyedu Kwarkye Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasing productivity and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. It powers self-driving cars, social media feeds, fraud detection and medical diagnoses. Touted as a game changer, it is projected to add nearly US15.7 trillion to the global economy , AI-led digital tools in use include drones for farm management, X-ray screening for tuberculosis diagnosis, and real-time tracking systems for packages and shipments. All these are helping to fill gaps in accessibility, efficiency and decision-making. However, it also introduces risks. These include biased algorithms, resource and labour exploitation, and e-waste disposal. The lack of a robust regulatory framework in many parts of the continent increases these challenges, leaving vulnerable populations exposed to exploitation. Limited public awareness and infrastructure further complicate the continent's ability to harness AI responsibly. What are African countries doing about it? To answer this, my research mapped out what Ghana and Rwanda had in place as AI policies and investigated how these policies were developed. I looked for shared principles and differences in approach to governance and implementation. The research shows that AI policy development is not a neutral or technical process but a profoundly political one. Power dynamics, institutional interests and competing visions of technological futures shape AI regulation. I conclude from my findings that AI's potential to bring great change in Africa is undeniable. But its benefits are not automatic. Rwanda and Ghana show that effective policy-making requires balancing innovation with equity, global standards with local needs, and state oversight with public trust. The question is not whether Africa can harness AI, but how and on whose terms. How they did it Rwanda's National AI Policy emerged from consultations with local and global actors. These included the Ministry of ICT and Innovation, the Rwandan Space Agency, and NGOs like the Future Society, and the GIZ FAIR Forward. The resulting policy framework is in line with Rwanda's goals for digital transformation, economic diversification and social development. It includes international best practices such as ethical AI, data protection, and inclusive AI adoption. Ghana's Ministry of Communication, Digital Technology and Innovations conducted multi-stakeholder workshops to develop a national strategy for digital transformation and innovation. Start-ups, academics, telecom companies and public-sector institutions came together and the result is Ghana's National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 2023-2033. Both countries have set up or plan to set up Responsible AI offices. This aligns with global best practices for ethical AI. Rwanda focuses on local capacity building and data sovereignty. This reflects the country's post-genocide emphasis on national control and social cohesion. Similarly, Ghana's proposed office focuses on accountability, though its structure is still under legislative review. Ghana and Rwanda have adopted globally recognised ethical principles like privacy protection, bias mitigation and human rights safeguards. Rwanda's policy reflects Unesco's AI ethics recommendations and Ghana emphasises ""trustworthy AI"". Both policies frame AI as a way to reach the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Rwanda's policy targets applications in healthcare, agriculture, poverty reduction and rural service delivery. Similarly, Ghana's strategy highlights the potential to advance economic growth, environmental sustainability and inclusive digital transformation. Key policy differences Rwanda's policy ties data control to national security. This is rooted in its traumatic history of identity-based violence. Ghana, ""defensive"" stance towards global tech powers; Ghana's is ""accommodative"". Rwanda works with partners that allow it to follow its own policy. Ghana, on the other hand, embraces partnerships, viewing them as the start of innovation. While Rwanda's approach is targeted and problem-solving, Ghana's strategy is expansive, aiming for large-scale modernisation and private-sector growth. Through state-led efforts, Rwanda focuses on using AI to solve immediate challenges such as rural healthcare access and food security. In contrast, Ghana looks at using AI more widely - in finance, transport, education and governance - to become a regional tech hub. Constraints and solutions The effectiveness of these AI policies is held back , while Rwanda and Ghana advocate for ethical AI, it's hard for them to hold multinational corporations accountable for breaches.

Training models require reliable electricity - a scarce resource in many parts of the continent. To address these gaps, I propose the following: Investments in digital infrastructure, education and local start-ups to reduce dependency on foreign tech giants. African countries must shape international AI governance forums. They must ensure policies reflect continental realities, not just western or Chinese ones. This will include using collective bargaining power through the African Union to bring Africa's development needs to the fore. It could also help with digital sovereignty issues and equitable access to AI technologies. Finally, AI policies must embed African ethical principles. These should include communal rights and post-colonial sensitivities.

"Commerce Nominee Promises Increased Domestic AI Production MeriTalk Home News Events Research Sponsored Content AI Cloud Cyber Data Opinion LinkedIn Twitter Search for: Menu Details By: Andrew Rice Nominee Promises Increased Domestic AI Production Howard Lutnick, President Donald Trumps nominee to lead the Department of Commerce, promised to lead an agency that prioritizes domestic artificial intelligence manufacturing and reduces regulation for that manufacturing capability. Senators on the Committee of Commerce, Science, and Transportation grilled Lutnick on a wide range of issues including AI export controls and intellectual property protections on Jan. 29. Throughout, Lutnick emphasized an approach aimed at dramatically increasing domestic production and cutting back regulations to increase global competition in AI development. Lets just unleash America for the benefit of America, Lutnick said. Weve been too constrained for too long. Thats over. It needs to be about American ingenuity. If you unleash American ingenuity, the scale , outperform the rest of the world will be incredible. It is a broad set of regulations that are holding back America, he said. A lesser regulatory environment will unleash America and we will be much, much better off with less of a hand on our head holding us down and more arms carrying us up. Lutnick repeatedly emphasized his goal to adopt Commerces model on cyber regulations to the rules for AI regulation. It has to be an American-driven leadership in AI, Lutnick said. Leverage what were great at, and issue standards and practices like we did in cyber that will encourage the private sector to be the dominant winner as we are in America. Lutnick elaborated further on the goals he has with regulation and said he wants the United States to dominate global standards for AI production. I think we should try to have a light touch model in AI, Lutnick said. Set up standards so the world heeds our standards and goes with our standards would be very important for America and something Im going to try to drive. When asked about the CHIPS and Science Act, Lutnick seemed hesitant to fully embrace the act. He appeared to have other ideas for increasing domestic semiconductor production. The CHIPS Act was an excellent down payment to begin that process, Lutnick said of increased domestic semiconductor production. We need to study it, but we need to make sure that we get the benefit of the bargain, and domestic manufacturing of semiconductors happens in America. Throughout his testimony, Lutnick continuously referred to his policy on tariffs, mentioning that he would use Commerces Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) to leverage them against China, specifically regarding tools used in developing AI and large language models. If theyre going to compete with us, let them compete with us, Lutnick said in reference to Chinas DeepSeek AI model. But stop using our tools to compete with us. Im thrilled to coordinate and empower BIS with tariffs, he continued. When we say no, the answer has got to be no.

"The Challenge of Falsehoods in AI Chatbots Skip to content Wed. Aug 2nd, 2023 CityLife The Power of AI Models AI Drones Military News Satellite Telephony Satellite Internet Space Technology Contact News The Challenge of Falsehoods in AI Chatbots ByGabriel Botha ChatGPT and other AI chatbots have been found to generate false information, posing a significant problem for businesses, organizations, and students who rely on them for document composition and work tasks. The issue of hallucination is acknowledged -founder of Anthropic, as a common problem among AI models. Despite efforts to enhance accuracy, there remains uncertainty about whether these models will ever be dependable enough to provide safe medical advice or handle high-stakes tasks. Generative AI technology encompasses more than just chatbots; it also includes image, video, music, and code generation. Google and other major companies are actively exploring the use of AI in news writing to ensure factual correctness. However, the problem of hallucination is not confined to text generationit extends to recipe creation as well, where even a single incorrect ingredient can render a meal inedible. While some experts, such as Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, are hopeful about resolving the issue of hallucination, others, like linguist Emily Bender, question whether improvements will be sufficient. Language models are designed to generate text based on trained data, but they often resort to fabricating information and mimicking various writing styles. Even when they produce correct text, it is often , hallucinations in AI-generated pitches are viewed as advantageous, as they offer unique ideas. Companies like Jasper AI collaborate with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta to provide customers with customized AI language models that cater to their specific requirements. While it is acknowledged that fixing hallucination will not be an easy task, there is hope that resources will be invested , there is an ongoing debate about the inherent limitations of AI technology in bridging this gap.

"Can AI benefit drinks retailers? - Drinks Retailing The Voice of Drinks Retailing News All News Beer News Cider News Spirits News Wine News Retailer News Mindful Drinking Convenience Corner Inspiring Indies Analysis Opinion Events Drinks Retailing Awards International Beer Challenge International Cider Challenge About About Us Contact Us Subscribe Advertise Request Media Pack Features List Digital Edition Innovation Hub Home Retailers Analysis Can AI benefit drinks retailers? By Rachel Badham 29 March, 2023 As emerging technology offers new ways to help retailers drive sales, Rachel Badham takes a look at how AI can be used in bricks-and-mortar stores With more retailers looking to streamline operations through the latest in-store technology, automated systems are being given an intelligent upgrade. From tracking consumer behaviour to helping retailers manage product inventory, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to not only provide key sales data, but to improve its efficiency as the system adapts and acquires more knowledge with continued usage. So, with promising capabilities and more developments to come in the world of AI, will these forms of technology become the norm for bricks-and-mortar drinks retailers? Brede Bjørhovd, chief product officer at Recognition a company that uses AI to provide in-store customer behaviour and traffic insights says that AI could become the most effective way for retailers to learn more about their customer base. We use AI to detect customers certain attributes and track their movements throughout the shopper journey. We are able to count them as they come in, see where they stop and experience friction, and when that specific customer exits. Compatible with any CCTV system, Recognition uses camera imagery to anonymously track customer behaviour. And when it comes to identifying behavioural trends, Bjørhovd thinks that AI is the best solution for retailers looking to boost sales without the extra legwork. We believe that, since customer behaviour is changing more rapidly than ever, retailers need to be able to adapt, he says. AI helps you do that , AI could prove helpful behind the scenes, with automation being one of the main draws for retailers looking to speed up operations. Tengiz Pataraia, co-founder of Envelope retail solutions, says the companys software which also functions through in-store CCTV cameras can automatically monitor stock levels, while also generating restocking alerts, which let staff know which product to restock and when. But benefits aside, how practical is AI-powered in-store tech, especially for independent retailers with fewer resources? For Recognitions Bjørhovd, making AI tech a part of a retailers repertoire means making the systems as accessible as possible for store owners. We present all of the information collected -consume dashboards, where retailers can then use their industry expertise to decide what the best course of action is. COST CONCERNS For retailers wary of the price tag, Envelopes Pataraia estimates that, while they vary from store to store, the price of subscribing to an AI tech programme rarely exceeds the salary of one employee for a supermarket with up to 100 cameras. Pataraia also notes the long-term benefits of in-store AI tech, saying it could encourage employee productivity ørhovd says the tech will also become more efficient, accurate and cost-effective, highlighting that the rise in AI systems has made them more affordable for smaller retailers. AI can help retailers make more sales , we think implementing AI into your workflow is a must to stay ahead.

Known for their gritty, bluesy sound, they balanced tough, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm-and-blues-oriented album material and were part of the British Invasion of the US. The original Animals were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, although Burdon did not attend and the band did not perform. In 2003, the band's version of The House of the Rising Sun ranked number 123 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list.

The world's largest memory chip, smartphone and TV maker estimated an operating profit of 9.1 trillion won (6.78 billion) for the three months ended Sept. 30, versus a 10.3 trillion won LSEG SmartEstimate. That would compare with 2.43 trillion won in the same period a year earlier and 10.44 trillion won in the preceding quarter.Web DevelopmentA Comprehensive ASP.NET Core MVC 6 Project Guide for 2024By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead InstructorView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)AI for Everyone: Understanding and Applying the Basics on Artificial IntelligenceBy - Ritesh Vajariya, Generative AI ExpertView Program FinanceA2Z Of Finance: Finance Beginner CourseBy - elearnmarkets, Financial Education , Developer and Lead InstructorView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)Basics of Generative AI : Unveiling Tomorrow's InnovationsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead InstructorView Program StrategySuccession Planning MasterclassBy - Nigel Penny, Global Strategy Advisor: NSP Strategy Facilitation Ltd.View Program MarketingDigital marketing - Wordpress Website DevelopmentBy - Shraddha Somani, Digital Marketing Trainer, Consultant, Strategiest and Subject Matter expertView Program FinanceCorporate Fraud and Forensic ModellingBy - Ankush Lamba, Managing Director- AnkuraView Program MarketingFuture of Marketing Branding MasterclassBy - Dr. David Aaker, Professor Emeritus at the Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley, Author Speaker Thought Leader Branding ConsultantView Program FinanceAI and Generative AI for FinanceBy - Hariom Tatsat, Vice President- Quantitative Analytics at BarclaysView Program FinanceBudget Analysis, Forecasting ControlBy - Mandar V.

Samsung's late response to the AI chip market increases its reliance on traditional, lower-margin chips, making it more vulnerable to competition from China and slowing demand for smartphones and PCs, analysts say. High-margin chips used in AI servers are driving a recovery in the chip market after a post-pandemic downturn last year. Still, Samsung has lagged SK Hynix in supplying high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to AI leader Nvidia. ""We have caused concerns about our technological competitiveness, with some talking about the crisis facing Samsung,"" Young Hyun Jun, Vice Chairman, Device Solutions Division, Samsung Electronics, said. ""These are testing times,"" he said, pledging to turn the challenge into an opportunity and focus on enhancing long-term technological competitiveness. Samsung's share price, already down more than 20 so far this year, fell 1.6 after the earnings guidance. HBM Chips Delayed Samsung said in a statement the start of sales of its high-end HBM3E chips to a major customer ""was delayed relative to our expectations"". It did not elaborate on the issue. Earnings declined in the company's memory chip business as Chinese rivals increased supplies of ""legacy"" products and some mobile customers adjusted inventories, offsetting solid demand for HBM and other chips used in servers, Samsung added. Samsung's contract chip manufacturing business, which designs and produces custom-made chips for other companies, likely continued to lose money in the third quarter as it is struggling to compete with leader TSMC, which counts Apple and Nvidia among its customers, analysts said. Samsung's chief Jay Y. Lee told Reuters on Monday that he is not interested in spinning off the contract chip manufacturing business as well as its logic chip designing operation. Samsung said one-off costs such as provisions for ""incentives"" and the unfavourable local currency also contributed to the chip earnings decline. Earnings in its mobile division improved from the preceding quarter on solid sales of its flagship smartphones, while earnings at its display unit grew as its customers, which include Apple, launched new models. Samsung will announce detailed earnings results later this month. In May, Samsung abruptly replaced the chief of its semiconductor division, handing the reins to Jun in a bid to overcome a ""chip crisis"". Samsung is also cutting as much as 30 of overseas staff at some divisions, Reuters reported in September, underscoring the challenges it faces. Its U.S. rival Micron last month forecast first-quarter earnings ahead of Wall Street estimates and reported its highest quarterly revenue in over a decade on the back of booming demand for its memory chips used in AI.

Tech Google DeepMind unveils next-generation drug discovery AI model Google DeepMind launches next-generation drug discovery AI model. Photo credit: AP Google Deepmind has announced the third major version of AlphaFold, an artificial intelligence model designed to help scientists design medicines and target diseases more effectively. In 2020, the company successfully used AI to predict the behavior of microscopic proteins, making a major breakthrough in the field of molecular biology. With the latest version of AlphaFold, researchers at DeepMind and sister company Isomorphic Labs, overseen , have mapped the behavior of all living molecules, including human DNA. From enzymes essential to human metabolism to antibodies that fight infections, the interactions between proteins and other molecules are key to drug discovery and development. (For the day's top tech news, subscribe to our technology newsletter Todays Cache) DeepMind said the findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, will reduce the time and funding needed to develop potentially life-changing treatments. These new capabilities allow scientists to design molecules that bind to specific locations on proteins and predict the strength of that binding, Hassabis said at a press conference on Tuesday. This is a critical step if you want to design drugs or compounds that help fight diseases. The company also announced the release of AlphaFold Server, a free online tool that scientists can use to test hypotheses before running real tests. Starting in 2021, AlphaFolds predictions will be freely accessible to nonprofit researchers as part of a database containing more than 200 million protein structures and have been cited thousands of times in other studies. DeepMind says the new server requires less computing knowledge and allows researchers to run tests with just a few clicks of a button. John Jumper, Senior Researcher at DeepMind, said: It will be critical to see how easily the AlphaFold server makes it easier for biologists, who are experts in biology rather than computer science, to test larger and more complex cases. Dr. Nicole Wheeler, a microbiology expert at the University of Birmingham, said the AlphaFold 3 was designed to be It has the potential to significantly speed up drug pipelines, he said.

Ltd., 6 min readSkyQuest Technology Consulting Pvt. Ltd.Global intraocular lens market was valued at USD 3.7 billion in 2021, and it is expected to attain a value of USD 5.38 billion by 2028, at a CAGR of 5.5 over the prediction period (20222028).Westford, USA, Sept. 14, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the population ages, there is an increasing demand for IOLs. IOLs are used to correct vision in people with a lens error problem, such as myopia. In the US, around 4 of the Americans are affected 1.4 billion people are having myopia and over 1 billion are suffering from cataract across the global intraocular lens market. Wherein, cataract (94 million), moderate or severe distance vision impairment or blindness due to unaddressed refractive error (88.4 million), corneal opacities (4.2 million), glaucoma (7.7 million), trachoma (2 million), and diabetic retinopathy (3.9 million) are the most prominent. However, the number of patients who need an IOL is increasing because the technology has improved and more people are developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD).Intraocular lens (IOL) implants are becoming increasingly popular, as they offer a number of benefits to those who need them. In particular, IOLs are quickly becoming a preferred option for people with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), as they provide better vision than the traditional eye drop method in intraocular lens market.As IOL demand continues to grow, manufacturers in the global intraocular lens market are working to create additional implant options that better meet individual needs. For example, some IOLs now come in low-profile designs that can be easily concealed beneath the eye. Additionally, some manufacturers are developing artificial vision systems that can help patients see more clearly even with damaged eyesight.Despite these advancements, there are still many patients who don't have access to an IOL. This is especially true in lower-income countries where medical technology is often not accessible or affordable. As a result, many of these patients rely on donated devices or grafts from other patients.Story continuesGet sample copy of this report: released its latest report on intraocular lens market. This comprehensive report provides detailed insights into the global intraocular lens market, including key trends, drivers, and challenges.The report also includes an in-depth analysis of the competitive landscape, with profiles of leading players in the market. SkyQuest's team of experts has used a robust research methodology to compile this comprehensive report, which will help companies operating in the intraocular lens market to make informed strategic decisions.AI to Improve Intra Ocular Prediction in Myopic Patients According to a study conducted , artificial intelligence (AI) has grown in popularity for the prediction of intraocular lens (IOL) size and fit for high myopic patients. The study used data from more than 64 patients who received IOLs. The researchers found that AI has potential to improve the accuracy of predicting IOL size and fit for high myopic patients, as compared to manual prediction methods in intraocular lens market. They also observed that AI can be more accurate in predicting IOL parameters such as power and especially sphere: volume ratios. The study authors suggest that AI could be used as a standalone tool or in conjunction with other prediction methods to improve patient outcome.Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of predictive models that can estimate the likelihood of a high myopic patient needing an intraocular lens (IOL). The AI models are typically used in conjunction with patient-specific data sets to create preliminary estimates of a patients risk for IOL failure in intraocular lens market.The use of AI for predicting IOL needs is not new, but its growing popularity is due, in part, to the increased availability of patient-specific data sets and the improved accuracy of the models. With such data, doctors can provide more informed recommendations about treatment options and avoid unnecessary surgery. Additionally, using AI allows patients to enjoy personalized care, thanks to the predictions made about their individual risk for IOL failure.The accuracy of AI-based predictions is likely to continue improving as additional patient data sets are collected and analyzed. At this point, AI is a valuable tool for predicting IOL needs and should be considered when evaluating a high myopic patient for treatment options.SkyQuests report on global intraocular lens market provides detailed insights into the competitive landscape and key players. These players are engaged in various strategies such as product launches and innovations, mergers and acquisitions, and partnerships and collaborations to expand their share in the global market.Browse summary of the report and Complete Table of Contents (ToC): Cataract is Attracting Demand for Intraocular Lens Market The number of people who suffer from cataracts as children is on the rise, and this is being driven in part by the high demand for intraocular lens (IOLs) among those affected. According to a new study published SkyQuest, the incidence of childhood cataracts has more than doubled over the past two decades, reaching nearly 3 million cases worldwide. In fact, it affects around 1-15 children per 10,000. Wherein, more than 70 children suffer from congenital cataract and over 28 have developmental cataract. The prevalence is especially high in low-income countries.This increase in the intraocular lens market is likely due to increased awareness and treatment of cataracts, which is also likely due to better diagnosis and care. Our study says that there is an unmet need for IOLs among those affected , they note that IOLs are now one of the leading causes of eye surgery in young people in many parts of the world.The presenting research analyst at SkyQuest noted that IOL demand from pediatric patients has been increasing at a rate of around 10 per year, which is almost at two times of the global intraocular lens market (5.5). He attributed this to the increased awareness and sophistication of pediatric ophthalmologists in managing cataract, as well as more effective methods for treating childhood cataracts. In fact, our study believes that pediatric patients represent a ""growing market"" for IOLs and being increasingly target : Intraocular Lens Market key players:Alcon (Switzerland)Bausch Health Inc.

A little more than a year ago, Elon Musk walked into Twitters San Francisco headquarters, fired its CEO and other top executives and began transforming the social media platform into whats now known as X. (AP PhotoKirsty Wigglesworth, Pool, File) by: BARBARA ORTUTAY, Associated Press Posted: Updated: SHARE We lost Twitter and got X. We tried out Bluesky and Mastodon (well, some of us did). We fretted about AI bots and teen mental health. We cocooned in private chats and scrolled endlessly as we did in years past. For social media users, 2023 was a year of beginnings and endings, with some soul-searching in between. Heres a look back some of the biggest stories in social media in 2023 and what to watch for next year: GOODBYE TWITTER A little more than a year ago, Elon Musk walked into Twitter s San Francisco headquarters, fired its CEO and other top executives and began transforming the social media platform into whats now known as X. Musk revealed the X logo in July. It quickly replaced Twitters name and its whimsical blue bird icon, online and on the companys San Francisco headquarters. And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds, Musk posted on the site. Because of its public nature and because it attracted public figures, journalists and other high-profile users, Twitter always had an outsized influence on popular culture but that influence seems to be waning. It had a lot of problems even before Musk took it over, but it was beloved brand with a clear role in the social media landscape, said Jasmine Enberg, a social media analyst at Insider Intelligence. There are still moments of Twitter magic on the platform, like when journalists took the platform to post real-time updates about the OpenAI drama, and the smaller communities on the platform remain important to many users. But the Twitter of the past 17 years is largely gone, and Xs reason for existence is murky. Since Musks takeover, X has been bombarded -ridden rant in an on-stage interview about companies that had halted spending on X. Musk asserted that advertisers that pulled out were engaging in blackmail and, using a profanity, essentially told them to get lost. Continuing the trend of welcoming back users who had been banned , Musk restored the X account of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, pointing to an unscientific poll he posted to his followers that came out in favor of the Infowars host who repeatedly called the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting a hoax. LGBTQ and other organizations supporting marginalized groups, meanwhile, have been raising alarms about X becoming less safe. In April, for instance, it quietly removed a policy against the targeted misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals. In June, the advocacy group GLAAD called it the most dangerous platform for LGBTQ people. GLSEN, an LGBTQ education group, announced in December that it was leaving X, joining other groups such as the suicide prevention nonprofit Trevor Project, saying that Musks changes have birthed a new platform that enables its users to harass and target the LGBTQ community without restriction or discipline. HELLO X. AND THREADS. AND BLUESKY Musks ambitions for X include transforming the platform into an everything app like Chinas WeChat, for instance. The problem? Its not clear if U.S. and Western audiences are keen on the idea. And Musk himself has been pretty vague on the specifics. While X contends with an identity crisis, some users began looking for a replacement. Mastodon was one contender, along with Bluesky, which actually grew out of Twitter a pet project of former CEO Jack Dorsey, who still sits on its board of directors. When tens of thousands of people, many of them fed-up Twitter users, began signing up for the (still) invite-only Bluesky in the spring, the app had less than 10 people working on it, said CEO Jay Graber recently. This meant scrambling to keep everything working, keeping people online, scrambling to add features that we had on the roadmap, she said. For weeks, the work was simply scaling ensuring that the systems could handle the influx. We had one person on the app for a while, which was very funny, and there were memes about Paul versus all of Twitters engineers, she recalled. I dont think we hired a second app developer until after the crazy growth spurt. Seeing an opportunity to lure in disgruntled Twitter users, Facebook parent Meta launched its own rival, Threads, in July. It soared to popularity as tens of millions began signing up though keeping people on has been a bit of a challenge. Then, in December, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in a surprise move that the company was testing interoperability the idea championed , Zuckerberg posted on Threads in December. Making Threads interoperable will give people more choice over how they interact and it will help content reach more people. Im pretty optimistic about this. MENTAL HEALTH WORRIES Social medias impact on childrens mental health hurtled toward a reckoning this year, with the U.S. surgeon general warning in May that there is not enough evidence to show that social media is safe for children and teens and calling on tech companies, parents and caregivers to take immediate action to protect kids now. Were asking parents to manage a technology thats rapidly evolving that fundamentally changes how their kids think about themselves, how they build friendships, how they experience the world and technology, , Dr. Vivek Murthy told The Associated Press. And were putting all of that on the shoulders of parents, which is just simply not fair. In October, dozens of U.S. states sued Meta for harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis éjar, a former engineering director at Meta, testified before a Senate subcommittee about social media and the teen mental health crisis, hoping to shed light on how Meta executives, including Zuckerberg, knew about the harms Instagram was causing but chose not to make meaningful changes to address them. The testimony came amid a bipartisan push in Congress to adopt regulations aimed at protecting children online. In December, the Federal Trade Commission proposed sweeping changes to a decades-old law that regulates how online companies can track and advertise to children, including turning off targeted ads to kids under 13 by default and limiting push notifications. WHAT TO WATCH FOR IN 24 Your AI friends have arrived but chatbots are just the beginning. Standing in a courtyard at his companys Menlo Park, California headquarters, Zuckerberg said this fall that Meta is focused on building the future of human connection and painted a near-future where people interact with hologram versions of their friends or coworkers and with AI bots built to assist them. The company unveiled an army of AI bots with celebrities such as Snoop Dogg and Paris Hilton lending their faces to play them that social media users can interact with. Next year, AI will be integrated into virtually every corner of the platforms, Enberg said. Social apps will use AI to drive usage, ad performance and revenues, subscription sign ups, and commerce activity. AI will deepen both users and advertisers reliance and relationship with social media, but its implementation wont be entirely smooth sailing as consumer and regulatory scrutiny will intensify, she added. The analyst also sees subscriptions as an increasingly attractive revenue stream for some platforms. Inspired , but they have persisted and expanded even as the social ad market has steadied itself. With major elections coming up in the U.S. and India among other countries, AIs and social medias role in misinformation will continue to be front and center for social media watchers. Were not prepared for this, A.J. Nash, vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm ZeroFox, told the AP in May. To me, the big leap forward is the audio and video capabilities that have emerged. When you can do that on a large scale, and distribute it on social platforms, well, its going to have a major impact.

Stocks for 2024 3 AI Stocks to Sell ASAP as Antitrust Concerns Rise AI Stocks to Sell Here's the best way to navigate the AI antitrust minefield , Advertisement The AI industry faces potential antitrust scrutiny and ethical concerns. C3.ai (AI): Its reliance on major clients and aggressive growth make it vulnerable amidst AI legal uncertainties. SoundHound AI (SOUN): A short seller report claims its technology is a commodity service facing stiff competition. Meta Platforms (META): Its extensive user data collection and existing antitrust issues could compound AI regulatory challenges. Source: shutterstock.comTex vector Alphabets (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) artificial intelligence-powered search engine, Google is under scrutiny for potentially devastating media outlets. All on speculation its AI Overviews could significantly reduce visibility and traffic to other websites. This forms the catalyst of my list of AI stocks to sell. A study estimates that websites might lose up to 64 of their organic traffic due to these AI Overviews. Additionally, Google faces accusations of scraping copyrighted news articles without credit or compensation. Not only is this bad news for Alphabet, but it also sparks a broader discussion about the ethical implications and competitive practices in the AI industry. If this accusation goes to court and ends up in a ruling against Alphabet, I think it could unleash a floodgate of similar lawsuits against other AI companies. All of which could potentially throw a spanner in the works to its long-term commercialization. With that being said, here are three AI stocks to sell. C3.ai (AI) Source: shutterstock.comBelow the SkyC3.ai (NYSE:AI) provides enterprise AI software solutions to accelerate digital transformation. The company has a range of AI applications for different industries. C3.ais heavy reliance on a few major clients and its aggressive growth strategy makes it vulnerable. In addition, doubt in the legal arena around AIs use case could further complicate matters. On the bright side, AI stock reported a smaller-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter loss while revenue topped estimates. Full-year fiscal 2025 guidance for C3.ai stock came in above expectations amid strength in its federal government business. Before the earnings announcement, nearly 30 of C3.ais shares were shorted. The better-than-expected results led to a short squeeze, pushing the stock higher. However, AIs valuation has now become inflated, trading at around 12-times sales. This is a far cry from its pandemic highs, but it still may be overvalued, especially with anti-trust headwinds on the horizon. SoundHound AI (SOUN) Source: rafapress Shutterstock.comSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN), a company specializing in voice AI technology, provides voice-enabled solutions across various industries. In its recent first-quarter report, SoundHound posted an adjusted loss of 7 cents per share on sales of 11.6 million, better than the expected 9 cents per share loss on 10.1 million in revenue. This performance marked a significant improvement from the previous years 8 cents per share loss on 6.7 million in sales. However, there is still a dark cloud hanging over SOUNs outlook from a short seller report that was published in March. The report claimed that SoundHounds speech recognition technology is a commodity service, competing with similar products from companies like Alphabet. It also stated that SoundHounds closest competitor, Cerence, invests significantly more in research and development and has been capturing SoundHounds customers. This AI uncertainty may be the last thing that SOUN needs right now, and it could be enough speculation for investors to give up investing in the company. Meta Platforms (META) Source: rafapress Shutterstock.comMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) collects vast amounts of data from user interactions, such as posts, likes, , and messaging. This data is utilized to personalize user experiences, target advertisements, and more. META has already been under fire under alleged anti-trust grounds. In April it requested a judge to dismiss the US Federal Trade Commissions (FTC) antitrust lawsuit, which seeks to break up the company , modeled after the European Unions regulations, poses new challenges for tech giants. The Digital Competition Bill targets systemically significant digital companies. The law aims to address the growing concentration of market power among a few large companies, which the panel argues creates an imbalance in bargaining power. With META already having use of user data and a lot on its plate from a regulatory perspective already, it could be another one of those AI stocks to sell given these headwinds.

Hundreds attend church service generated by ChatGPT to find out By Associated Press New Published on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on Linkedin (AP) The artificial intelligence chatbot asked the believers in the fully packed St. Pauls church in the Bavarian town of Fuerth to rise from the pews and praise the Lord. The ChatGPT chatbot, personified 300 people who had shown up on Friday morning for an experimental Lutheran church service almost entirely generated , the avatar said with an expressionless face and monotonous voice. The 40-minute service including the sermon, prayers and music was created , because I would say about 98 comes from the machine, the 29-year-old scholar told The Associated Press. The AI church service was one of hundreds of events at the convention of Protestants in the Bavarian towns of Nuremberg and the neighboring Fuerth, and it drew such immense interest that people formed a long queue outside the 19th-century, neo-Gothic building an hour before it began. The convention itself Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchentag in German takes place every two years in the summer at a different place in Germany and draws tens of thousands of believers to pray, sing and discuss their faith. They also talk about current world affairs and look for solutions to key issues, which this year included global warming, the war in Ukraine and artificial intelligence. This years gathering is taking place from Wednesday to Sunday under the motto Now is the time. That slogan was one of the sentences Simmerlein fed ChatGPT when he asked the chatbot to develop the sermon. I told the artificial intelligence We are at the church congress, you are a preacher what would a church service look like? Simmerlein said. He also asked for psalms to be included, as well as prayers and a blessing at the end. You end up with a pretty solid church service, Simmerlein said, sounding almost surprised , focusing on the challenges of the present, overcoming fear of death, and never losing trust in Jesus Christ. The entire service was led , and two young men. At times, the AI-generated avatar inadvertently drew laughter as when it used platitudes and told the churchgoers with a deadpan expression that in order to keep our faith, we must pray and go to church regularly. Some people enthusiastically videotaped the event with their cell phones, while others looked on more critically and refused to speak along loudly during The Lords Prayer. Heiderose Schmidt, a 54-year-old who works in IT, said she was excited and curious when the service started but found it increasingly off-putting as it went along. There was no heart and no soul, she said. The avatars showed no emotions at all, had no body language and were talking so fast and monotonously that it was very hard for me to concentrate on what they said. But maybe it is different for the younger generation who grew up with all of this, Schmidt added. Marc Jansen, a 31-year-old Lutheran pastor from Troisdorf near the western German city of Cologne, brought a group of teenagers from his congregation to St. Paul. He was more impressed , Jansen said. What the young pastor missed, however, was any kind of emotion or spirituality, which he says is essential when he writes his own sermons. Anna Puzio, 28, a researcher on the ethics of technology from the University of Twente in The Netherlands, also attended the service. She said she sees a lot of opportunities in the use of AI in religion such as making religious services more easily available and inclusive for believers who for various reasons may not be able experience their faith in person with others in houses of worship. However, she noted there are also dangers when it comes to the use of AI in religion. The challenge that I see is that AI is very human-like and that its easy to be deceived , we dont have only one Christian opinion, and thats what AI has to represent as well, she said. We have to be careful that its not misused for such purposes as to spread only one opinion. Simmerlein said it is not his intention to replace religious leaders with artificial intelligence. Rather, he sees the use of AI as a way to help them with their everyday work in their congregations. Some pastors seek inspiration in literature, he says, so why not also ask AI for ideas regarding an upcoming sermon. Others would like to have more time for individual spiritual guidance of their parishioners, so why not speed up the process of writing the sermon with the help of a chatbot to make time for other important duties. Artificial intelligence will increasingly take over our lives, in all its facets, Simmerlein said. And thats why its useful to learn to deal with it. However, the experimental church service also showed the limits to implementing artificial AI in church, or in religion. There was no real interaction between the believers and the chatbot, which wasnt able to respond to the laughter or any other reactions , she buries the people, she knows them from the beginning, Simmerlein said. Artificial intelligence cannot do that. It does not know the congregation. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the APs collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Joanna Smith-Griffin, 33, of Raleigh, North Carolina, was arrested in her home state and charged with securities and wire fraud, along with identity theft. She founded ALLHere Education Inc., an artificial intelligence technology company that created Ed the chatbot. The Los Angeles Unified School District was among those that used the product for a time before shutting it down, citing the financial collapse of Smith-Griffins company. Authorities say the companys products were also used in other major school districts including New York City and Atlanta. An indictment unsealed Tuesday in Manhattan federal court accused Smith-Griffin of making misrepresentations to investors that enabled her to collect millions of dollars illegally from them since 2020. It says she used some of the fraudulently obtained money from investors to put a down payment on her home in North Carolina and to pay for her wedding. After the company collapsed and employees were laid off, it entered bankruptcy proceedings and a trustee took over its finances, authorities said. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a release that she orchestrated a deliberate and calculated scheme to deceive investors in AllHere Education, Inc., inflating the companys financials to secure millions of dollars under false pretenses. It was not immediately clear who would represent her in an afternoon court appearance in North Carolina. James E. Dennehy, head of New Yorks FBI office, said she misrepresented the composition of her startup company and masqueraded as a financial consultant to perpetuate the scheme once discrepancies were discovered. He said her selfishly prioritizing personal expenses over the companys needs damaged the potential for improved learning environments across major school districts, according to the release.

We will seek answers to this question, the station head, Marcin Pulit, wrote in a statement.The change got nationwide attention after Mateusz Demski, a journalist and film critic who until recently hosted a show on the station, published an open letter Tuesday protesting the replacement of employees with artificial intelligence. It is a dangerous precedent that hits us all, he wrote, and argued it could open the way to a world in which experienced employees associated with the media sector for years and people employed in creative industries will be replaced by machines.More than 15,000 signed the petition , many of them young people who do not want to be the subject of such an experiment.Demski worked at OFF Radio Krakow from February 2022, carrying out interviews with Ukrainians fleeing war, until August, when he was among about a dozen journalists who were let go. He said the move was especially shocking because the broadcaster is a taxpayer-supported public station.Pulit insisted that no journalists were fired because of AI but because its listenership was close to zero.Krzysztof Gawkowski, the minister of digital affairs and a deputy prime minister, weighed in on Tuesday, saying he had read Demskis appeal and that legislation is needed to regulate AI.Although I am a fan of AI development, I believe that certain boundaries are being crossed more and more, he wrote on X. The widespread use of AI must be done for people, not against them!On Tuesday the station broadcast an interview conducted ława Szymborska, a Polish poet and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature who died in 2012.Michał Rusinek, the president of the Wisława Szymborska Foundation, which oversees the poets legacy, told the broadcaster TVN that he agreed to let the station use Szymborskas name in the broadcast. He said the poet poet had a sense of humor and would have liked it."

Nexstar Media Wire Professor attempts to fail students after falsely accusing them of using ChatGPT to cheat by: Lexi Lonas, The Hill Posted: Updated: by: Lexi Lonas, The Hill Posted: Updated: SHARE (The Hill) A professor at Texas AM University-Commerce attempted to fail all his students in an animal science class after he incorrectly concluded they used ChatGPT to complete their assignments, according to multiple reports. Jared Mumm sent an email to his class on Monday as students were finishing up for the semester, claiming he discovered they all used artificial intelligence on their essays, The Washington Post and Rolling Stone reported. A Reddit post of the alleged email says Mumm would be giving everyone an incomplete after he discovered students used Chat GTP, a misspelling of the technology he used several times. The professor says he ran the last three assignments all the students did through ChatGPT two separate times to ensure he knows they cheated. I will not grade chat Gpt s, Mumm allegedly said to one student in a screenshot provided to Post. Other plagiarism detection companies such as the popular Turnitin have introduced AI detection into their platforms, but ChatGPT is not capable of reliably detecting if an essay was written by itself. 6 in 10 view AI as threat to humanitys future: poll The school has said the incident had not led any students to fail or not be allowed to graduate, but at least one student did come forward and say they used ChatGPT at other points in the class. Jared Mumm, the class professor, is working individually with students regarding their last written assignments. Some students received a temporary grade of Xwhich indicates incompleteto allow the professor and students time to determine whether AI was used to write their assignments and, if so, at what level, the school said in a statement. Rolling Stone reports some students have already sent in evidence and timestamps from Google Documents to prove they wrote their own essays. Weve been through a lot to get these degrees, one student told The Post. The thought of my hard work not being acknowledged, and my character being questioned. It just really frustrated me. The university added in its statement it is developing policies to address the use or misuse of AI technology in the classroom. The Hill has reached out to Mumm for further comment.

For years weve provided additional levels of transparency for election ads, including paid for , were expanding our policies a step further to require advertisers to disclose when their election ads include material thats been digitally altered or generated.

Internet Brands Autos 2025 VW Golf teased at CES with integrated ChatGPT by: Viknesh Vijayenthiran - Motor Authority Posted: Updated: by: Viknesh Vijayenthiran - Motor Authority Posted: Updated: SHARE Volkswagen will reveal an updated version of its Golf compact car later this month, and the automaker used 2024 CES currently underway in Las Vegas to reveal some of the planned technology updates. The hightlight is the introduction of the ChatGPT AI system to enhance VWs IDA voice assistant. VW worked with technology company Carence to integrate ChatGPT into its vehicles operating system and said the popular chatbot will become a standard feature in some markets starting in the second quarter of 2024. With the prompt, Hello IDA, vehicle occupants will be able to use a combination of a vehicles own voice assistant and ChatGPT to control some of the vehicle functions, such as media, navigation, and climate settings, as well as to answer general knowledge questions. The capabilities will be continuously expanded, VW said. Initial models to receive the system will be the updated Golf, as well as the ID.7, ID.5, ID.4, ID.3, new Tiguan, and new Passat. VW said the feature is still being considered for the U.S. and more details about its availability will be announced in due course. 2025 Volkswagen Golf GTI prototype2025 Volkswagen Golf GTI prototype2025 Volkswagen Golf GTI prototype For anyone concerned about the potential for their personal data to be exposed, VW said ChatGPT doesnt gain access to any vehicle data, and questions and answers are deleted immediately after use. The updated Golf is expected to reach the U.S. later this year as a 2025 model. Once again the U.S. is only likely to receive the sporty Golf GTI and Golf R grades. VW presented a camouflaged prototype of the updated Golf GTI at CES. The prototype reveals minor styling changes like a revised front fascia, as well as a revised dash with a larger infotainment screen. For the full updated Golf range, VW has promised new powertrains, new electronic driver-assist features, and next-generation software systems, including a new infotainment system. Buyers looking for electric power will have to wait until the Golfs next redesign. VW last September confirmed the next Golf will be an electric vehicle based on Volkswagen Groups upcoming SSP modular platform. It means the Golf GTI and Golf R will also likely be EVs in their next iterations, so fans better start preparing to bid farewell to the idea of a gas engine in those cars. They have some time, as the SSP platform will be ready around 2028.

"Bob Dylan in Japan: portrait of a strangely happy bard - Pledge Times About Us Disclaimer for Pledge Times T C Contact Us Sunday, Pledge Times World Business Gaming Tech Entertainment Science Lifestyle Health Sports World Business Gaming Tech Entertainment Science Lifestyle Health Sports No Result View All Result Pledge Times No Result View All Result Home World Bob Dylan in Japan: portrait of a strangely happy bard by admin_l6ma5gus in World 0 Dylanism is an almost incomprehensible religion that is extraordinarily expensive, but at least it provides numerous arguments to believe in salvation. The new artifact that Bob Dylans parishioners will elevate to the status of object of desire is an apotheotic box of four CDs with the two complete concerts that originally fueled the live double LP At Budokan, published at the end of 1978 only in Japan and a few months later, due to curiosity and good reception, already throughout the world. Compared to the brief 22 cuts that we knew from the original double vinyl, we now have the 58 pieces that were played in the Tokyo pavilion those nights of February 28 and . And all of this comes packaged with an irresistible display for the devotee: an exciting 56-page booklet with abundant photographic material and several essays with the ins and outs of those events, and a box of fetishes, memories or memorabilia including tour posters, ticket reproductions and other stationery. The treat is extremely tempting, although not suitable for everyones budget: those who think of invoking the Kings of the East should know that the monarchical bill will exceed 150 euros. And then it is important to decide to what extent the material that is now offered to us in such a diabolically appealing packaging is valuable. Its historical interest does not allow discussion. The artistic one is much more opinionable, taking into account that the criticisms of 45 years ago ranged between nuanced interest and merciless swipe. But the influence is that the faithful were not yet accustomed to those reinventions that Zimmerman has turned into a watchword that is always curious, sometimes disconcerting and on more than one occasion exasperating. The feeling that predominates after a long immersion in those nights at the Budokan is that time has suited these recordings much better than we suspected. More information At Budokan It was once a Gold Record in the United States and a very popular album in Spain (it reached number 17 on the charts), taking into account that the second half of the seventies coincided with the countrys awakening to democracy and a series of extraordinarily popular records among the general public (yes, Dylan was a mainstream artist). Nobody doubted anymore Desire like a masterpiece, Street Legal gained abundant followers and Slow Train Coming would arrive in mid-1978 with the debate on conversion to Christianity and the claim of that playful Man Gave Name To All The Animalswhich almost seemed like the Dylanite equivalent of Yellow Submarine in the Beatles repertoire. See also 'We have been deceived': why the 'stickers' replace the emojisBob Dylan, in Venice, Italy (2004).Dominique Issermann In short, there will be many fans who have a deep and endearing sentimental memory of this recording on Japanese soil, testimony to Dylans first tour away from the United States since 1966. But lets not fool ourselves: At Budokan It was the subject of controversy and even ridicule, even caricatured as the equivalent in the bards history to Elvis stays in Las Vegas. It is a flawed but fascinating document of Dylan at the crossroads, the magazine ruled ambivalently. Rolling Stone. Even today, the digital portal All Music warns, in a review of two stars out of five: Who is this for? Its interest is historical, if anything, and only marginally. It was greatly influenced 1964 Olympic Games, was Zimmermans third almost consecutive live performance, after the extraordinary Before The Flood (1974), along with The Band, and the most irrelevant Hard Rain (1976). But just as that album of barely 50 minutes was not capable of testifying to the mammoth Rolling Thunder Revue tourimmortalized in the superb fifth volume of the Bootleg Seriesand even in a back box of 15 CDs with all the concerts, only for the very fans, the At Budokan of 1978-79 is far below what we now discover with The Complete Budokan. The instrumental alignment and spirit of that staging 45 years ago is somehow the opposite of what old Bob has been applying in the last moments of his present (and virtually eternal) Never Ending Tour. If the current formulation is that of the absolute absence of concessions, with harsh and torn readings of the originals, viciously demolished until they are unrecognizable, that Dylan who was revered in the heart of the Japanese archipelago behaved with sweetness and even unequivocal good humor in the bands presentations, affable and almost humorous. Especially when it comes to his three female backup singers: on the night of Tuesday, February 28, he announces Helena Springs as his fiancée, while Debi Dye is given the title of ex-wife. 24 hours later he does not attribute affiliations to them, but assures that he met them singing in a department store. See also Party of the assassinated Shinzo Abe leads the elections in JapanBob Dylan, recording Highway 61 Revisited, in 1965.Michael Ochs Archives (Getty Images) Was that joker Dylan happy who embarked on his mammoth 1978 world tour in the Far East, a total of 114 concerts (none in Spain) that attracted nearly two million spectators? Be careful: he was embarking in the direction of Renaldo and Clara, a colossal surreal film that almost no one liked, and had to deal with the musical boom of punk and disco, two genres that saw him, at 36 years old, as an old glory already amortized. But, judging , we are tempted to think that they were busy months. The person in charge of Dylans catalog at Japans CBS at that time, Heckel Sugano, relates that the companys general director, Norio Ohga, organized a farewell party on at Maxims restaurant for which no one was counting. with the presence of todays Nobel Prize winner in Literature. To everyones surprise, Sugano reveals, Dylan appeared, showing signs of feeling comfortable; He took the time to sign posters for everyone and he stayed enjoying the celebration until the end. That the complete tapes of the two Tokyo nights have survived these four and a half decades without blemish is enough to believe in providence, so the Dylanite sleuths will do well to delight in all the material so far on the shelves. The introduction of the concerts, a A Hard Rains A-gonna Fall instrumental and routine, it seems to promote a docile and sweetened tone that later does not correspond to reality. In fact, the second cuts are occupied (Tuesday and Love Her With A Feeling (Wednesday), absolute rarities in the Dylanite catalogue. The most characteristic element happens to be the almost omniscient presence of the tenor sax and the flute of Steve Douglas, a signing from Phil Spectors team in the years of the Wall of Sound who does not hide his desire for prominence. There is ample room for dissent, but Dylan has never been so loving, lyrical and precious as in those Japanese latitudes when it comes to approaching monuments the size of Just Like A Woman, Is Your Love In Vain? either Blowin In The Windhere almost transfigured into the category of gospel. See also Japan approves reform that includes the lack of consent as a key in sexual crimesIf we leave aside the cut of the bands presentations, Dylan performed 28 songs in each of the evenings at the Budokan, with 23 coincidences and five variations depending on whether we look at the repertoire of February 28 or March 1. The most unique thing may be the superb interpretation of Going, Going, Gone (with variations in the lyrics, another sacrilege for purists) or the inclusion, the second evening, of an absolutely heavenly and very rare The Man In Melong before the Coens revived it in The Big Lebowski. If anyone still doubts Bobs excellence as a vocalist, they should listen to this and apologize forever. More curiosities for the insatiable fan? That among the titles not repeated on the 28th and the 1st were masterpieces of the caliber of Tomorrow Is A Long Time, Dont Think Twice Its All Right either Knockin On Heavens Door. Even in its most ductile and domesticated version, you see, genius was always unpredictable. And, as has already happened to us with other materials dusted from the archives (all the material around his highly criticized self portrait 1970, for example), even the most debatable, or discussed, Dylan turns out to be capital. The unexpected Tokyo box is, never better said, an Asian luxury, but it allows a period that we had forgotten in our memory to shine in all its splendor.

"Google's New AI Can Make Music From Just a Few Words Skip to content ProPrice Lens How To Tools 3G, 4G Call Packages Careers About Contact Us Tech and Telecom Business CarBase Sports Education Others ProProperty Perspective Aviation Social Career Videos PSL 2023 Googles New AI Can Make Music From Just a Few Words By Aasil Ahmed Published has developed an impressive new AI system, MusicLM, that can generate music in any genre from a text description. However, the company has no plans to release it due to potential risks. ALSO READ Here Are The Top 15 Biggest Tech Layoffs Of All Time While other AI systems for composing music have been developed, such as Riffusion, Dance Diffusion, Googles AudioML, and OpenAIs Jukebox, MusicLM is unique in its ability to create complex and high-fidelity songs due to its advanced technology and extensive training data. MusicLM, as described in an academic paper, was trained using a dataset of 280,000 hours of music. This training allows it to generate coherent songs based on descriptions of significant complexity such as enchanting jazz song with a memorable saxophone solo and a solo singer or Berlin 90s techno with a low bass and strong kick. The resulting songs are similar to those created , considering that it does not involve human musicians or instrumentalists. Here is a sample. Yesterday, Google published a paper on a new AI model called MusicLM. The model generates 24 kHz music from rich captions like ""A fusion of reggaeton and electronic dance music, with a spacey, otherworldly sound. Induces the experience of being lost in space."" pic.twitter.comXPv0PEQbUh Product Hunt (ProductHunt) ALSO READ Google Pixel 7s Affordable Sibling Appears in Hands On Video Even with detailed and complex descriptions, MusicLM is able to capture nuances like instrumental riffs, melodies, and moods. MusicLMs capabilities extend beyond just generating short clips of songs. Google researchers have demonstrated that the system can build on existing melodies, whether they are hummed, sung, whistled, or played on an instrument. Additionally, MusicLM can take several descriptions written in sequence, such as time to meditate, time to wake up, time to run, or time to give 100, and create a melodic story or narrative that can range up to several minutes in length, making it ideal for movie soundtracks. Here are a few more samples. 今日もまた世界が変わってたGoogleの研究チームがテキストから音楽を生成するMusicLMを公開似たようなサービスは前もあったけどそれとは次元が違うさすがGoogle公式ページ IOが待ち遠しい pic.twitter.comMnJqX65BIL sangmin.eth ChoimiraiSchool (gijigae) MusicLM can also be instructed through a combination of pictures and captions, or generate audio that is played , or requirements, like motivational music for workouts. Still, as mentioned earlier, Google does not plan to release MusicLM to the public due to the risks and challenges posed : We acknowledge the risk of potential misappropriation of creative content associated to the use case. We strongly emphasize the need for more future work in tackling these risks associated to music generation.

Learn how our funding model works. , and impartiality. Our content, created :DR Startup launches AI friend pendant, offering a less creepy companion for users. Friend AI, powered by Claude 3.5, listens and engages via Bluetooth-connected iOS devices. Founder sees AI Friend as a response to global loneliness, aiming to provide meaningful companionship. Having an imaginary friend can now become a reality, as a startup launches an AI friend which is only slightly less creepy than you might think. It sounds like something from a Black Mirror episode, especially as you have to wear your Friend around your neck. The company behind the product (which is also named friend) has created an AI wearable that is in the form of a pendant necklace. One that is always listening. The pendant is a small puck that is home to the AI chatbot that has been created to keep people company. How does Friend AI work? The friend sends you messages about the latest gossip, engages in conversations, and can even provide you with some motivation when you need it most. This works through connecting to an iOS device as it functions over Bluetooth and requires an internet connection. The AI friend is powered by Anthropic AIs Claude 3.5 large language model. It also has an onboard microphone to listen to all the juicy details. On the companys website, the how it works section details three steps all of which are relatively easy. Firstly, users are asked to speak their minds or gossip about what was overheard. Secondly, the AI friend will think for a moment and come up with something good to say. Thirdly, simply check your phone as a message will be sent to your device where you can see the response from your new friend. The friend is already available for preorders for 99. The AI Friend aims to be a companion in a time when its needed most While many companies have been scrambling to address productivity needs, the founder of this tool Avi Schiffmann told Wired: Productivity is over, no one cares. No one is going to beat Apple or OpenAI or all these companies that are building Jarvis. The most important things in your life really are people. While the thought of an AI friend sounds strange, a loneliness epidemic is sweeping countries worldwide, exacerbated by aging populations (particularly in countries like South Korea). At the end of 2023, the World Health Organization declared loneliness a global public health concern and said it was as bad for peoples health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Ive never felt more lonely in my entire life, said the 21-year-old founder, who spent 1.8 million to acquire the friend.com domain. And in that moment, I was looking at the Tab prototype, and I was like, its not that I just want to talk to this thing. I want to feel like this companion is actually there with me traveling.
